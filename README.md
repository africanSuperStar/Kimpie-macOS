Neuronific spawned from the notion that composable mobile applications are possible through the use of Mondaic Parser Combinators.

`Neuronific` is a spin off of the word `Neuron` which in it's own right is a simpler composite of a larger ecosystem of biological constructs, making up the brain.

# Description

Neuronific is an attempt create a `Drag n Drop` cross-platform app builder using JSON as the basis for creating views. Many derivations of similar ideas have recently spawned, however are cut short when complexity and scaling of creativity creates a problem. In the app world things should be infinitely possible. We plan to add features rapidly and with increasing usability. 

We've mapped out a plan which encompasses getting version 1.0.0 stable enough to publish an iOS application with full use of the _Human Interface Guidelines_. Of course an application is not interesting without its data. Access to a multitude of API's as well Persistent Storage are a high priority for us.

Linking data to the many possible interactions of UI Components and at different States is also a task this project hopes to solve.
